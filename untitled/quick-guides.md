# Quick Guides

The following guides have been built with the sole purpose of giving developers, and explorers alike, a foundational understanding of how the different tools and elements of the Ontology framework connect, and work with each other using practical examples and sample code.

The quick guides assume a certain level of understanding of the distributed development environment, apart from the basic knowledge of certain tools such as Git and Shell script.

At the end of each quick guide, you will have at least an entry level understanding of the respective component or process that the guide targets. We hope this will suffice to break the ice and significantly increase your development efficiency in terms of employing and implementing the Ontology framework.
