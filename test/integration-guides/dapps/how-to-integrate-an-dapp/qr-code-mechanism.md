# QR code mechanism

This section aims at assisting the developer with integrating the QR code protocol `dAPI` into a dApp. This would allow the user to carry out services like login, invoke smart contracts, and more by scanning QR codes.

The parties involved in the process are:

* `dApp` side: Providing `dApps` for the users who are a part of the Ontology ecosystem is an important priority at Ontology.
* `Provider` side: Implementing `dAPI mobile` standard wallets.
