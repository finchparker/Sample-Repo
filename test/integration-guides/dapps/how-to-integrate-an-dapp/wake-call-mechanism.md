# Wake call mechanism

Certain wallet applications that implement special adaptation layers support being called from within other applications on the phone.

In this section, we talk about how to wake the wallet from inside an application and implement features such as login and smart contract invocation \(including payment method\). For more details on the application wake mechanism, please refer to [Android application demo](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/android-app-demo).
