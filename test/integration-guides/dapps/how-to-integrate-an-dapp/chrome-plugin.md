# Chrome Plugin

Before using the [dAPI for Chrome](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-dapi), it is necessary to first install and implement a wallet that has the `dAPI provider` functionality built into it, for e.g., [Cyano Wallet for Chrome](https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/cyano-wallet).

The `dAPI` can be implemented using `TypeScript`, and can also be used in `JavaScript` programs.

Some of the more popular usage channels for `dApps`, apart from opening the `dApp` in the `Chrome` browser, also support launching it in the mobile wallet. The access scheme for opening the `dApp` in the wallet is illustrated [here](https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-cn/dApp-Integration/01-DAppDocking-Wallet-Opens-DApp).

To ensure that the requirement for `dApps` to be accessible on both the browser and the mobile version, here we provide examples that involve using `dAPI` in three different scenarios. You can refer to:

* **Mobile version** `dAPI` **implementation -** [_dAPI for mobile_](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/cyano-bridge)\_\_
* **Chrome plugin wallet** `dAPI` **implementation -** [_dAPI for chrome_](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-dapi)\_\_
* **Example** `dAPI` **code compatible with both the Chrome plugin and the mobile version -** [_dAPI-universal_](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/dapi-universal)\_\_
